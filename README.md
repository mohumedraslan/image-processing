# image-processing
This experiment introduces basic image preprocessing techniques using Python and OpenCV. Learn how to manipulate images by performing tasks like color space conversion, geometric transformations, grayscale adjustments, histogram equalization, and filtering. The goal is to prepare raw images for further analysis or machine learning applications
